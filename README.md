# Publishing open access at low cost: what are our options?

Create a resource where people can get information on journals where they can publish at zero or low cost

## Agenda
We will search for high impact journals that publish at low cost or have a waiver for Kenya and the other East African countries and put them in a table that can be easily retrieved. The table will also contain instructions to follow to get the waiver. 
If time allows we will add a list of predatory journals to avoid.
